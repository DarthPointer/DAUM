This is an early test version! Weird shit can happen!

You MUST have Offseter tool 1.1 or higher downloaded for actual benefits from automation!

Only one mode supported: d'n'drop a .uasset to initiate "interactive" mode. With only one operation.
-n -a [name_to_add_to_name_map].

How to use:
0) Open Config.json and change offSetterPath value to absolute filename of OffSetter.exe.
1) D'n'drop a .uasset.
2) Type commands. As of now only -n -a [name] is supported, it extends name map with a name you pass it.

Warning!
I have not tested the tool properly yet. Backup and check twice what you type!
